# Module9: 	Configure Azure Files and Azure File Sync 

## Azure Files

- shared storage for applications by using the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS) protocols.
- Azure VMs and other cloud services can share the data by mounting file shares.
- On-premise applications also access file data in the share.

## Manage Azure Files

- Azure Files provide 2 protocols to mount file share - SMB and NFS
- Files do not support both SMB and NFS on the same file share.

### Types of file shares

1. __Standard__

- uses Hard disk drives(HDD) for storing data.
- can be used with SMB and REST protocols only.

2. __Premium__

- uses Solid state drives (SSD) for storing data.
- can be used with SMB, NFS and REST protocols.
