Your organization is migrating storage to Azure. As the Azure Administrator you need to:

1. Evaluate the use of Azure storage for storing files. These files are currently residing in on-premises data stores.
2. Minimize the cost of storage by placing less frequently accessed files in lower-priced storage tiers.
3. Explore different protection mechanisms that Azure Storage offers, including network access, authentication, authorization, and replication.
4. Determine to what extent Azure Files service might be suitable for hosting your on-premises file shares.
